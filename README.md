# Splitter

## What:

##### You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

- [X] there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
- [X] we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
- [X]  whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
- [X] we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
- [X] Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.

Stretch goals:

- [ ] add a kill switch to the whole contract.
- [X] make the contract a utility that can be used by David, Emma and anybody with an address to split Ether between any 2 other addresses of their own choice.
- [ ] cover potentially bad input data.
- [ ] rebuild the Splitter instance state only based on events.
- [ ] do inheritance and import.
